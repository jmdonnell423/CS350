# CS350
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project involved developing software to interface with hardware components using a microcontroller. The primary goal was to control and monitor temperature sensors through I2C communication, with outputs displayed via UART. This solution addressed the need for real-time temperature monitoring in embedded systems.

What did you do particularly well?
I effectively integrated multiple hardware components using well-structured interface software. My implementation of the I2C communication protocol was particularly strong, ensuring reliable data transfer between the microcontroller and sensors.

Where could you improve?
I could improve the documentation and comments within the codebase to make it more accessible to others who might work on the project in the future. Additionally, optimizing the code for lower power consumption could be an area of focus.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding the Texas Instruments SimpleLink SDK and the CCS IDE as essential tools for future embedded systems projects. I also plan to rely more on the TI E2E Community and GitHub for collaboration and code versioning.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
Skills in interfacing software with hardware components, understanding I2C communication, and using real-time operating systems (RTOS) are highly transferable. These skills will be applicable in future embedded systems projects and any coursework involving low-level hardware interaction.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I structured the code using modular design principles, separating hardware initialization, communication protocols, and data processing into distinct functions. This approach not only improves readability but also makes the project easier to maintain and adapt for future use cases.
